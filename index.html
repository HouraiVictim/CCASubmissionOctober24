            <p>Touhou Project is a bullet hell shoot em' up video game series created by Team Shanghai Project. It was first created in 1995, starting on the PC-98 system. Then in 2002, it made a huge switch to the Windows platform, continuing on Touhou 6: Embodiment of the Scarlet Devil.
            </p>
            <p>Aside from the wonderful story that ZUN (the creator of Touhou, also know as the sole member of Team Shanghai Project) provided with his games, the most interesting and enjoyable aspect of Touhou is its community. Spanning over two decades, the world of Touhou has nurtured a world-wide community responsible for tens of thousands of fanworks shared around the Internet. </p>

                <h3>Glossary</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Danmaku - the romanji for 弾幕, which means "bullet hell" in Japanese.</li>
                    <li>Mukyu (むきゆ)- A fan-popular phrase sometimes said by Patchouli Knowledge, a character from Embodiment of the Scarlet Devil.</li>
                    <li>Gensokyo - the main location used in Touhou Project. It is said to be located in and around the Yatsugatake Mountains in Japan.</li>
                    <li>Fumo (ふも) - plushie recreations of Touhou characters manufactured and sold by GIFT. They are very popular within the fandom and can be bought online through GIFT's website.</li>
                    <li>1cc (One Credit Clear) - a term frequently used by players of the Touhou games. To accomplish a 1cc run, you must beat a game without having to use an extra credit.</li>
                </ul>
            </Aside>

            <p>Since a majority of Touhou's fanworks is made by the Japanese community, you can obviously expect to see an overwhelming number of fanworks in Japanese.</p>
