                        <p>This is the music webpage. Perhaps the most influential and famous aspect about Touhou is its marvelous arrangements by ZUN. If you have been browsing the Internet for long enough, you've probably listened to a Touhou song (or atleast a parody/remix of it). Here you can find the musical/audio content of the site.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Danmaku - the romanji for 弾幕, which means "bullet hell" in Japanese.</li>
                            <li>Mukyu (むきゆ)- A fan-popular phrase sometimes said by Patchouli Knowledge, a character from Embodiment of the Scarlet Devil.</li>
                            <li>Gensokyo - the main location used in Touhou Project. It is said to be located in and around the Yatsugatake Mountains in Japan.</li>
                            <li>Fumo (ふも) - plushie recreations of Touhou characters manufactured and sold by GIFT. They are very popular within the fandom and can be bought online through GIFT's website.</li>
                            <li>1cc (One Credit Clear) - a term frequently used by players of the Touhou games. To accomplish a 1cc run, you must beat a game without having to use an extra credit.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </Aside>
        
                    <p>Since a majority of Touhou's fanworks is made by the Japanese community, you can obviously expect to see an overwhelming number of fanworks in Japanese.</p>
